# False-Social-Media-Profile-Detection-and-Reporting-using-NLP-and-Logistic-Regression

<h2>Overview</h2>
Fake profile detection is a critical challenge in online social networks because of the proliferation of vindictive and malicious exercises like identity theft, fraud, and misinformation. This project presents an investigation concerning the viability of logistic regression for detecting fake profiles. 
This project aims to analyze consumer sentiments in Amazon reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project compares the performance of three pre-trained transformer models: VADER, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT.<br>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
Contains the dataset used for sentiment analysis.<br>
Contains the pre-trained transformer models used for analysis.<br>
Contains Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.<br>
Contains the results of the sentiment analysis experiments.<br>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Python 3.x<br>
Jupyter Notebook<br>
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, transformers<br>

<h2>Installation</h2>
Clone the repository: bash<br>
Copy code: git clone https://github.com/your-username/consumer-sentiment-analysis.git <br>
Install the required libraries:
Copy code: pip install -r requirements.txt<br>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Preprocess the data<br>
Train the models<br>
Evaluate the models<br>
Compare the results<br>

<h2>Results</h2>
The results of the analysis show the comparative performance of VADER, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.<br>
